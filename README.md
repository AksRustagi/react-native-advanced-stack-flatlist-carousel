In this tutorial we are going to create a stack carousel animation in React Native using FlatList, Animated API and FlingGestureHandler from react-native-gesture-handler package.

I'm also going to show you a technique that I call interconnected animations or reactive animations, where 2 different animations react to each other.

I'm going to teach you how to

- create a stack style carousel
- how to create a reactive animated value
- how to do infinite scrolling and fetch new data
- how to create a flicker type animation when changing the active slide
